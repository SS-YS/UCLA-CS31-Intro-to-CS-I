a. 
A problem that I encountered when doing project 2 is making my output number contain exactly two digits to the right of the decimal point. I knew that professor mentioned this during lectures but I forgot its details. So I watched the lectures again and found out that "cout.setf(ios::fixed); cout.precision(2);" would work.
